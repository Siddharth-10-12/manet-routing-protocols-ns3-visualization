 Advanced MANET Routing Protocols Simulation and Visualization using NS-3
 
 **Project Title**:

“Comparative Performance Analysis and Visualization of MANET Routing Protocols (AODV, DSDV, DSR, and OLSR) using NS-3 and NetAnim”

 **Description:**

This project focuses on simulating and visualizing the performance of Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) routing protocols using NS-3 (Network Simulator 3).
It integrates both network-level performance analysis and visual insights through Python-based data visualization and NS-3’s NetAnim tool.

** Objectives:**

Simulate and compare the behavior of AODV, DSDV, DSR, and OLSR protocols

Evaluate metrics such as:

Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR)

Throughput

End-to-End Delay

Routing Overhead

Generate interactive visualizations (heatmaps, bar charts, scatter plots)

Visualize node mobility and packet transmission using NetAnim XML outputs
